<center><h1> Huan sock [hwan sog]</h1></center>

 <center>The circle indicates that the person who became a monk is returning to the trick. A person who has a chance to return can also become a monk. It is possible to repeat the ritual and the ringing up to seven times,but the person who is expelled by the following four things can not go back.</center>

<br>

1. Sexual intercourse: engaging in any sexual intercourse.

2. Stealing: the robbery of anything worth more than 1/24 troy ounce of gold (as determined by local law).

3. Intentionally bringing about the death of a human being — whether by killing the person, arranging for an assassin to kill the person, inciting the person to die, or describing the advantages of death.

4. Deliberately lying to another person that one has attained a superior human state, such as claiming to be an arahant when one knows one is not, or claiming to have attained one of the jhanas when one knows one has not.

I'm not a monk. but sometimes i feel like i'm a monk. similar to monk, I do meditation everyday. amd coincidentally my sister majored Budhism. 

I have a Question to my self. A monk, who returned to the trick, is a normal person or still a monk? like Schrödinger's katze, I think that the monk is half normal half monk.

This is really fundamental Question to me. Because I always reflect myself. compared to mine Shakespeare's Question 'to be or not to be' is simple. cause there is no selection 'half being half not being'

## Hello everyone. 
## I'm a Huan sock. 
## I think a lot. 
## and I know it's problem.

<center>
이 블로그를 통해 잡생각들을 적어볼까 합니다.  

블로그에 남은 잡생각들이 잘 썩어 비료가 되길 바랍니다.  

비료아래에 열심히 씨 뿌리고 농사 짓다보면 언젠가 행복한 농부가 되어있지 않을까요?  

행복한 농부까지는 아니더라도 소박한 농부는 될 수 있지 않을까요?
